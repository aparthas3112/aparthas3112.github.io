        arcs at 856--1712\textbackslash,MHz, observed with the MeerKAT
        Thousand Pulsar Array Programme. Scintillation arcs appear to be
        ubiquitous in clean, high S/N observations, their detection
        mainly limited by short observing durations and coarse frequency
        channel resolution. This led the survey to be sensitive to
        nearby, lightly scattered pulsars with high effective velocity
        -- from a large proper motion, a screen nearby the pulsar, or a
        screen near the Earth. We measure the arc curvatures in all of
        our sources, which can be used to give an estimate of screen
        distances in pulsars with known proper motion, or an estimate of
        the proper motion. The short scintillation timescale in
        J1731$-$4744 implies a scattering screen within
        12\textbackslash,pc of the source, strongly suggesting the
        association between this pulsar and the supernova remnant RCW
        114. We measure multiple parabolic arcs of 5 pulsars, all of
        which are weakly scintillating with high proper motion.
        Additionally, several sources show hints of inverted arclets
        suggesting scattering from anisotropic screens. Building on this
        work, further targeted MeerKAT observations of many of these
        pulsars will improve understanding of our local scattering
        environment and the origins of scintillation; annual
        scintillation curves would lead to robust screen distance
        measurements, and the evolution of arclets in time and frequency
        can constrain models of scintillation.}",

     abstract = "{The Double Pulsar, PSR J0737-3039A/B, has offered a wealth of
        gravitational experiments in the strong-field regime, all of
        which GR has passed with flying colours. In particular, among
        current gravity experiments that test photon propagation, the
        Double Pulsar probes the strongest spacetime curvature.
        Observations with MeerKAT and, in future, the SKA can greatly
        improve the accuracy of current tests and facilitate tests of
        NLO contributions in both orbital motion and signal propagation.
        We present our timing analysis of new observations of PSR
        J0737-3039A, made using the MeerKAT telescope over the last 3
        years. The increased timing precision offered by MeerKAT yields
        a 2 times better measurement of Shapiro delay parameter s and
        improved mass measurements compared to previous studies. In
        addition, our results provide an independent confirmation of the
        NLO signal propagation effects and already surpass the previous
        measurement from 16-yr data by a factor of 1.65. These effects
        include the retardation effect due to the movement of B and the
        deflection of the signal by the gravitational field of B. We
        also investigate novel effects which are expected. For instance,
        we search for potential profile variations near superior
        conjunctions caused by shifts of the line-of-sight due to
        latitudinal signal deflection and find insignificant evidence
        with our current data. With simulations, we find that the
        latitudinal deflection delay is unlikely to be measured with
        timing because of its correlation with Shapiro delay.
        Furthermore, although it is currently not possible to detect the
        expected lensing correction to the Shapiro delay, our
        simulations suggest that this effect may be measured with the
        full SKA. Finally, we provide an improved analytical description
        for the signal propagation in the Double Pulsar system that
        meets the timing precision expected from future instruments such
        as the full SKA.}",

     abstract = "{Context. PSR J0955{\ensuremath{-}}6150 is a member of an enigmatic class
        of eccentric millisecond pulsar (MSP) and helium white dwarf (He
        WD) systems (eMSPs), whose binary evolution is poorly understood
        and believed to be strikingly different to that of traditional
        MSP+He WD systems in circular orbits. \textbackslash Aims:
        Measuring the masses of the stars in this system is important
        for testing the different hypotheses for the formation of eMSPs.
        \textbackslash Methods: We carried out timing observations of
        this pulsar with the Parkes radio telescope using the 20 cm
        multibeam and ultra-wide bandwidth low-frequency (UWL)
        receivers, and the L-band receiver of the MeerKAT radio
        telescope. The pulse profiles were flux and polarisation
        calibrated, and a rotating-vector model (RVM) was fitted to the
        position angle of the linear polarisation of the combined
        MeerKAT data. Pulse times of arrival (ToAs) were obtained from
        these using standard pulsar analysis techniques and analysed
        using the TEMPO2 timing software. \textbackslash Results: Our
        observations reveal a strong frequency evolution of this MSP's
        intensity, with a flux density spectral index
        ({\ensuremath{\alpha}}) of {\ensuremath{-}}3.13(2). The improved
        sensitivity of MeerKAT resulted in a greater than tenfold
        improvement in the timing precision obtained compared to our
        older Parkes observations. This, combined with the eight-year
        timing baseline, has allowed precise measurements of a very
        small proper motion and three orbital post-Keplerian parameters,
        namely the rate of advance of periastron,
        {\ensuremath{\omega}}{\ensuremath{\dot{}}} = 0.00152(1) deg
        yr$^{{\ensuremath{-}}1}$, and the orthometric Shapiro delay
        parameters, h$_{3}$ = 0.89(7) {\ensuremath{\mu}}s and
        {\ensuremath{\varsigma}} = 0.88(2). Assuming general relativity,
        we obtain M$_{p}$ = 1.71(2) M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ for the
        mass of the pulsar and M$_{c}$ = 0.254(2)
        M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ for the mass of the companion; the
        orbital inclination is 83.2(4) degrees. Crucially, assuming that
        the position angle of the linear polarisation follows the RVM,
        we find that the spin axis has a misalignment relative to the
        orbital angular momentum of > 4.8deg at 99\% confidence level.
        \textbackslash Conclusions: While the value of M$_{p}$ falls
        well within the wide range observed in eMSPs, M$_{c}$ is
        significantly smaller than expected from several formation
        hypotheses proposed, which are therefore unlikely to be correct
        and can be ruled out; M$_{c}$ is also significantly different
        from the expected value for an ideal low mass X-ray binary
        evolution scenario. If the misalignment between the spin axis of
        the pulsar and the orbital angular momentum is to be believed,
        it suggests that the unknown process that created the orbital
        eccentricity of the binary was also capable of changing its
        orbital orientation, an important evidence for understanding the
        origin of eMSPs.}",

        timing millisecond pulsars (MSPs) to high precision (< 1 $\mu$s)
        to study the Galactic MSP population and to contribute to global
        efforts to detect nanohertz gravitational waves with the
        International Pulsar Timing Array (IPTA). In order to plan for
        the remainder of the programme and to use the allocated time
        most efficiently, we have conducted an initial census with the
        MeerKAT ``L-band'' receiver of 189 MSPs visible to MeerKAT and
        here present their dispersion measures, polarization profiles,
        polarization fractions, rotation measures, flux density

        uses coherent dedispersion, interferometric polarization
        calibration techniques, and a uniform flux scale), they present
        an excellent resource for population studies. We used wideband

        Array, a global collaboration synthesizing decadal-length
        pulsar-timing campaigns in North America, Europe, and Australia.
        In our reference search for a power-law strain spectrum of the
        form $h_c = A(f/1\, \mathrm{yr}^{-1})^{\alpha }$, we found
        strong evidence for a spectrally similar low-frequency
        stochastic process of amplitude $A = 3.8^{+6.3}_{-2.5}\times
        10^{-15}$ and spectral index {\ensuremath{\alpha}} = -0.5
        {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.5, where the uncertainties represent 95 per
        cent credible regions, using information from the auto- and
        cross-correlation terms between the pulsars in the array. For a
        spectral index of {\ensuremath{\alpha}} = -2/3, as expected from
        a population of inspiralling supermassive black hole binaries,
        the recovered amplitude is $A = 2.8^{+1.2}_{-0.8}\times

        Hellings-Downs correlations that would indicate a gravitational-
        wave origin was found. We also analysed the constituent data
        from the individual pulsar timing arrays in a consistent way,

        is more sensitive. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this
        combined data set produces comparable constraints to recent
        single-array data sets which have more data than the constituent
        parts of the combination. Future international data releases
        will deliver increased sensitivity to gravitational wave

        B1937+21. These data more closely track intrinsic noise because
        X-rays are unaffected by the radio-frequency-dependent

        yields strong evidence (natural log Bayes factor of 9.634

        the search is inconclusive for PSR B1937+21. In the interest of
        future X-ray missions, we devise and implement a method to
        simulate longer and higher-precision X-ray data sets to
        determine the timing baseline necessary to detect red noise. We
        find that the red noise in PSR B1937+21 can be reliably detected
        in a 5 yr mission with a TOA error of 2 {\ensuremath{\mu}}s and
        an observing cadence of 20 observations per month compared to
        the 5 {\ensuremath{\mu}}s TOA error and 11 observations per

        investigate detecting red noise in PSR B1937+21 with other
        combinations of observing cadences and TOA errors. We also find
        that time-correlated red noise commensurate with an injected

        A $_{GWB}$ = 2 {\texttimes} 10$^{-15}$ and spectral index of
        timing residuals of {\ensuremath{\gamma}} $_{GWB}$ = 13/3 can be
        detected in a pulsar with similar TOA precision to PSR B1937+21.

     abstract = "{The nature of dark matter remains obscure in spite of decades of
        experimental efforts. The mass of dark matter candidates can
        span a wide range, and its coupling with the Standard Model
        sector remains uncertain. All these unknowns make the detection
        of dark matter extremely challenging. Ultralight dark matter,
        with m {\ensuremath{\sim}}10$^{{\ensuremath{-}}22}$ eV, is
        proposed to reconcile the disagreements between observations and
        predictions from simulations of small-scale structures in the
        cold dark matter paradigm while remaining consistent with other
        observations. Because of its large de Broglie wavelength and
        large local occupation number within galaxies, ultralight dark
        matter behaves like a coherently oscillating background field
        with an oscillating frequency dependent on its mass. If the dark
        matter particle is a spin-1 dark photon, such as the U (1$_{)
        B}$ or U (1$_{) B {\ensuremath{-}}L}$ gauge boson, it can induce
        an external oscillating force and lead to displacements of test
        masses. Such an effect would be observable in the form of
        periodic variations in the arrival times of radio pulses from
        highly stable millisecond pulsars. In this study, we search for
        evidence of ultralight dark photon dark matter (DPDM) using
        14-year high-precision observations of 26 pulsars collected with
        the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array. While no statistically
        significant signal is found, we place constraints on coupling
        constants for the U (1$_{) B}$ and U (1$_{) B
        {\ensuremath{-}}L}$ DPDM. Compared with other experiments, the
        limits on the dimensionless coupling constant
        {\ensuremath{\varepsilon}} achieved in our study are improved by
        up to two orders of magnitude when the dark photon mass is
        smaller than 3 {\texttimes}10$^{{\ensuremath{-}}22}$ eV

        analysis for each of the six pulsars. We consider several types
        of noise: (i) radio frequency independent, 'achromatic', and
        time-correlated red noise; (ii) variations of dispersion measure
        and scattering; (iii) system and band noise; and (iv)
        deterministic signals (other than gravitational waves) that
        could be present in the PTA data. We perform Bayesian model
        selection to find the optimal combination of noise components
        for each pulsar. Using these custom models we revisit the
        presence of the common uncorrelated red noise signal previously
        reported in the EPTA DR2 and show that the data still supports

        there is no preference for or against the Hellings-Downs spatial

        background. The main conclusion of the EPTA DR2 paper remains
        unchanged despite a very significant change in the noise model
        of each pulsar. However, modelling the noise is essential for
        the robust detection of gravitational waves and its impact could

        long-term low-frequency stochastic signal common to all pulsars,
        a common red signal (CRS), with the characteristic Hellings-
        Downs (HD) spatial correlation. Our analysis is performed with
        two independent pipelines, ENTERPRISE, and TEMPONEST+FORTYTWO,

        Pulsar-Array (TPA) programme in the MeerTime project. For a
        centre frequency of 1284 MHz, we obtain 762 W$_{10}$
        measurements across the total bandwidth of 775 MHz, where
        W$_{10}$ is the width at the 10 per cent level of the pulse
        peak. We also measure about 400 W$_{10}$ values in each of the
        four or eight frequency sub-bands. Assuming, the width is a
        function of the rotation period P, this relationship can be
        described with a power law with power law index
        {\ensuremath{\mu}} = -0.29 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.03. However,
        using orthogonal distance regression, we determine a steeper
        power law with {\ensuremath{\mu}} = -0.63 {\ensuremath{\pm}}
        0.06. A density plot of the period-width data reveals such a fit
        to align well with the contours of highest density. Building on
        a previous population synthesis model, we obtain population-
        based estimates of the obliquity of the magnetic axis with
        respect to the rotation axis for our pulsars. Investigating the
        width changes over frequency, we unambiguously identify a group
        of pulsars that have width broadening at higher frequencies. The
        measured width changes show a monotonic behaviour with frequency
        for the whole TPA pulsar population, whether the pulses are
        becoming narrower or broader with increasing frequency. We
        exclude a sensitivity bias, scattering and noticeable
        differences in the pulse component numbers as explanations for
        these width changes, and attempt an explanation using a
        qualitative model of five contributing Gaussian pulse components

     abstract = "{A nanohertz-frequency stochastic gravitational-wave background can
        potentially be detected through the precise timing of an array
        of millisecond pulsars. This background produces low-frequency
        noise in the pulse arrival times that would have a
        characteristic spectrum common to all pulsars and a well-defined
        spatial correlation. Recently the North American Nanohertz
        Observatory for Gravitational Waves collaboration (NANOGrav)
        found evidence for the common-spectrum component in their 12.5
        yr data set. Here we report on a search for the background using
        the second data release of the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array. If we
        are forced to choose between the two NANOGrav models-one with a
        common-spectrum process and one without-we find strong support
        for the common-spectrum process. However, in this paper, we
        consider the possibility that the analysis suffers from model
        misspecification. In particular, we present simulated data sets
        that contain noise with distinctive spectra but show strong
        evidence for a common-spectrum process under the standard
        assumptions. The Parkes data show no significant evidence for,
        or against, the spatially correlated Hellings-Downs signature of
        the gravitational-wave background. Assuming we did observe the
        process underlying the spatially uncorrelated component of the

        $A={2.2}_{-0.3}^{+0.4}\times {10}^{-15}$ in units of
        gravitational-wave strain at a frequency of 1 yr$^{-1}$.
        Extensions and combinations of existing and new data sets will
        improve the prospects of identifying spatial correlations that
        are necessary to claim a detection of the gravitational-wave

        combined pulse arrival-time measurements made with the 100 m

        relativistic effects in binary pulsars to enable measurements of
        neutron star masses and tests of theories of gravity. We
        selected 25 pulsars as an initial high priority list of targets
        based on their characteristics and observational history with
        other telescopes. In this paper, we provide an outline of the
        programme, and present polarization calibrated pulse profiles
        for all selected pulsars as a reference catalogue along with
        updated dispersion measures. We report Faraday rotation measures
        for 24 pulsars, twelve of which have been measured for the first
        time. More than a third of our selected pulsars show a flat
        position angle swing confirming earlier observations. We
        demonstrate the ability of the Rotating Vector Model, fitted
        here to seven binary pulsars, including the Double Pulsar (PSR
        J0737-3039A), to obtain information about the orbital
        inclination angle. We present a high time resolution light curve

        discovery of eight new millisecond pulsars in six different
        clusters. Two new binaries, 47 Tuc ac and 47 Tuc ad, are
        eclipsing 'spiders', featuring compact orbits
        ({\ensuremath{\lesssim}}0.32 d), very low mass companions, and
        regular occultations of their pulsed emission. The other three

        dwarfs or neutron stars. NGC 6624G has a large eccentricity of e
        ≃ 0.38, which enabled us to detect the rate of advance of

        the Galactic magnetar SGR J1935+2154 on 2020 April 28 added
        credence to this hypothesis. We report on simultaneous and non-
        simultaneous observing campaigns using the Arecibo, Effelsberg,
        LOFAR, MeerKAT, MK2, and Northern Cross radio telescopes and the
        MeerLICHT optical telescope in the days and months after the
        April 28 event. We did not detect any significant single radio
        pulses down to fluence limits between 25 mJy ms and 18 Jy ms.
        Some observing epochs overlapped with times when X-ray bursts
        were detected. Radio images made on 4 d using the MeerKAT
        telescope revealed no point-like persistent or transient
        emission at the location of the magnetar. No transient or
        persistent optical emission was detected over seven days. Using

        J1935+2154, to be between 1.5 and 6.5 kpc. The upper limit is
        consistent with some other distance indicators and suggests that
        the April 28 burst is closer to two orders of magnitude less
        energetic than the least energetic FRBs. The lack of single-
        pulse radio detections shows that the single pulses detected
        over a range of fluences are either rare, or highly clustered,
        or both. It may also indicate that the magnetar lies somewhere

        explored this on the bright millisecond pulsar PSR J0437-4715 by
        exploring the DM of literally every pulse. We found that the
        derived single-pulse DMs vary by typically 0.0085 cm$^{-3}$ pc
        from the mean, and that the best DM estimate is limited by the
        differential pulse jitter across the band. We postulate that all
        millisecond pulsars will have their own limit on DM precision
        which can only be overcome with longer integrations. Using high-
        time resolution filterbank data of 9 {\ensuremath{\mu}}s, we
        also present a statistical analysis of single-pulse
        phenomenology. Finally, we discuss optimization strategies for
        the MeerKAT pulsar timing program and its role in the context of
        the International Pulsar Timing Array.}",

     abstract = "{Intensity scintillations of radio pulsars are known to originate from
        interference between waves scattered by the electron density
        irregularities of interstellar plasma, often leading to
        parabolic arcs in the two-dimensional power spectrum of the
        recorded dynamic spectrum. The degree of arc curvature depends
        on the distance to the scattering plasma and its transverse
        velocity with respect to the line of sight. We report the
        observation of annual and orbital variations in the curvature of
        scintillation arcs over a period of 16 yr for the bright
        millisecond pulsar, PSR J0437-4715. These variations are the
        signature of the relative transverse motions of Earth, the
        pulsar, and the scattering medium, which we model to obtain
        precise measurements of parameters of the pulsar's binary orbit
        and the scattering medium itself. We observe two clear
        scintillation arcs in most of our >5000 observations, and we
        show that they originate from scattering by thin screens located
        at distances D$_{1}$ = 89.8 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.4 pc and
        D$_{2}$ = 124 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 3 pc from Earth. The best-fit
        scattering model we derive for the brightest arc yields the
        pulsar's orbital inclination angle, i = 137{\textdegree}1
        {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0{\textdegree}3, and longitude of ascending
        node, {\ensuremath{\Omega}} = 206{\textdegree}3
        {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0{\textdegree}4. Using scintillation arcs for
        precise astrometry and orbital dynamics can be superior to
        modeling variations in the diffractive scintillation timescale,
        because the arc curvature is independent of variations in the
        level of turbulence of interstellar plasma. This technique can
        be used in combination with pulsar timing to determine the full
        three-dimensional orbital geometries of binary pulsars and
        provides parameters essential for testing theories of gravity
        and constraining neutron star masses.}",

        J1818.0-1607, following it for more than one month with high
        cadence. The observations commenced less than 35 h after its
        registered first outburst. We obtained timing, polarization, and
        spectral information. Swift J1818.0-1607 has an unusually steep
        spectrum for a radio emitting magnetar and also has a relatively
        narrow and simple pulse profile. The position angle swing of the
        polarization is flat over the pulse profile, possibly suggesting
        that our line of sight grazes the edge of the emission beam.
        This may also explain the steep spectrum. The spin evolution
        shows large variation in the spin-down rate, associated with
        four distinct timing events over the course of our observations.
        Those events may be related to the appearance and disappearance
        of a second pulse component. The first timing event coincides
        with our actual observations, while we did not detect
        significant changes in the emission properties that could reveal
        further magnetospheric changes. Characteristic ages inferred
        from the timing measurements over the course of months vary by
        nearly an order of magnitude. A longer-term spin-down
        measurement over approximately 100 d suggests a characteristic
        age of about 500 yr, larger than previously reported. Though
        Swift J1818.0-1607 could still be one of the youngest neutron
        stars (and magnetars) detected so far, we caution using the
        characteristic age as a true-age indicator given the caveats

        temperature ( ${∼}18 \mbox{K at }20 \mbox{cm}$ ) radio array
        that currently operates at 580-1 670 MHz and can produce tied-
        array beams suitable for pulsar observations. This paper
        presents results from the MeerTime Large Survey Project and
        commissioning tests with PTUSE. Highlights include observations
        of the double pulsar $\mbox{J}0737{-}3039\mbox{A}$ , pulse
        profiles from 34 millisecond pulsars (MSPs) from a single 2.5-h
        observation of the Globular cluster Terzan 5, the rotation
        measure of Ter5O, a 420-sigma giant pulse from the Large
        Magellanic Cloud pulsar PSR $\mbox{J}0540{-}6919$ , and nulling
        identified in the slow pulsar PSR J0633-2015. One of the key
        design specifications for MeerKAT was absolute timing errors of
        less than 5 ns using their novel precise time system. Our timing
        of two bright MSPs confirm that MeerKAT delivers exceptional
        timing. PSR $\mbox{J}2241{-}5236$ exhibits a jitter limit of $<4
        \mbox{ns h}^{-1}$ whilst timing of PSR $\mbox{J}1909{-}3744$
        over almost 11 months yields an rms residual of 66 ns with only
        4 min integrations. Our results confirm that the MeerKAT is an
        exceptional pulsar telescope. The array can be split into four
        separate sub-arrays to time over 1 000 pulsars per day and the
        future deployment of S-band (1 750-3 500 MHz) receivers will
        further enhance its capabilities.}",

        irregularities in their rotation: red timing noise and glitches.
        Using modern Bayesian techniques, we investigated the timing
        noise properties of 300 bright southern-sky radio pulsars that
        have been observed over 1.0-4.8 yr by the upgraded Molonglo
        Observatory Synthesis Telescope (MOST). We reanalysed the spin
        and spin-down changes associated with nine previously reported
        pulsar glitches, report the discovery of three new glitches and
        four unusual glitch-like events in the rotational evolution of
        PSR J1825-0935. We develop a refined Bayesian framework for
        determining how red noise strength scales with pulsar spin
        frequency ({\ensuremath{\nu}}) and spin-down frequency (
        $\dot{\nu }$ ), which we apply to a sample of 280 non-recycled
        pulsars. With this new method and a simple power-law scaling
        relation, we show that red noise strength scales across the non-
        recycled pulsar population as $\nu ^{a} |\dot{\nu }|^{b}$ ,
        where $a = -0.84^{+0.47}_{-0.49}$ and $b = 0.97^{+0.16}_{-0.19}$
        . This method can be easily adapted to utilize more complex,
        astrophysically motivated red noise models. Lastly, we highlight
        our timing of the double neutron star PSR J0737-3039, and the
        rediscovery of a bright radio pulsar originally found during the
        first Molonglo pulsar surveys with an incorrectly catalogued
        position.}",

        Telescope, in which six FRBs were detected between 2017 June and
        2018 December. By using a real-time FRB detection system, we
        captured raw voltages for five of the six events, which allowed
        for coherent dedispersion and very high time resolution (10.24
        {\ensuremath{\mu}}s) studies of the bursts. Five of the FRBs
        show temporal broadening consistent with interstellar and/or
        intergalactic scattering, with scattering time-scales ranging
        from 0.16 to 29.1 ms. One burst, FRB181017, shows remarkable
        temporal structure, with three peaks each separated by 1 ms. We
        searched for phase-coherence between the leading and trailing
        peaks and found none, ruling out lensing scenarios. Based on
        this survey, we calculate an all-sky rate at 843 MHz of
        98\^\{+59\}\_\{-39\} events sky$^{-1}$ d$^{-1}$ to a fluence
        limit of 8 Jy ms: a factor of 7 below the rates estimated from

        derived spectral index {\ensuremath{\alpha}} = -1.6
        (F$_{{\ensuremath{\nu}}}$ {\ensuremath{\propto}}
        {\ensuremath{\nu}}$^{{\ensuremath{\alpha}}}$). Our results
        suggest that FRB spectra may turn over below 1 GHz. Optical,
        radio, and X-ray follow-up has been made for most of the

        timing programme that is part of the UTMOST project at the
        refurbished Molonglo Observatory Synthesis Radio Telescope
        (MOST) near Canberra, Australia. We currently observe more than
        400 mainly bright southern radio pulsars with up to daily
        cadences. For 205 (8 in binaries, 4 millisecond pulsars), we
        publish updated timing models, together with their flux
        densities, flux density variability, and pulse widths at 843
        MHz, derived from observations spanning between 1.4 and 3 yr. In
        comparison with the ATNF pulsar catalogue, we improve the
        precision of the rotational and astrometric parameters for 123
        pulsars, for 47 by at least an order of magnitude. The time
        spans between our measurements and those in the literature are
        up to 48 yr, which allow us to investigate their long-term spin-
        down history and to estimate proper motions for 60 pulsars, of
        which 24 are newly determined and most are major improvements.
        The results are consistent with interferometric measurements
        from the literature. A model with two Gaussian components
        centred at 139 and 463 km s$^{-1}$ fits the transverse velocity
        distribution best. The pulse duty cycle distributions at 50 and
        10 per cent maximum are best described by lognormal
        distributions with medians of 2.3 and 4.4 per cent,
        respectively. We discuss two pulsars that exhibit spin-down rate
        changes and drifting subpulses. Finally, we describe the
        autonomous observing system and the dynamic scheduler that has
        increased the observing efficiency by a factor of 2-3 in

        dark matter model. As shown by Khmelnitsky and Rubakov, such a
        scalar field in the Galaxy would produce an oscillating
        gravitational potential with nanohertz frequencies, resulting in
        periodic variations in the times of arrival of radio pulses from
        pulsars. The Parkes Pulsar Timing Array (PPTA) has been
        monitoring 20 millisecond pulsars at two- to three-week
        intervals for more than a decade. In addition to the detection
        of nanohertz gravitational waves, PPTA offers the opportunity
        for direct searches for fuzzy dark matter in an astrophysically
        feasible range of masses. We analyze the latest PPTA data set
        which includes timing observations for 26 pulsars made between
        2004 and 2016. We perform a search in this data set for evidence
        of ultralight dark matter in the Galaxy using Bayesian and
        Frequentist methods. No statistically significant detection has
        been made. We, therefore, place upper limits on the local dark
        matter density. Our limits, improving on previous searches by a
        factor of 2 to 5, constrain the dark matter density of
        ultralight bosons with m {\ensuremath{\leq}}10$^{-23}$ eV to be
        below 6 GeV cm$^{-3}$ with 95\% confidence in the Earth
        neighborhood. Finally, we discuss the prospect of probing the
        astrophysically favored mass range m
        {\ensuremath{\gtrsim}}10$^{-22}$ eV with next-generation pulsar
        timing facilities.}",

        latency (<24 s) and machine-learning based FRB detection system.
        The FRB discovery was accompanied by the capture of voltage data
        at the native time and frequency resolution of the observing
        system, enabling coherent dedispersion and detailed off-line
        analysis that have unveiled fine temporal and frequency
        structure. The dispersion measure (DM) of 176.80
        {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.04 pc cm$^{-3}$ is the lowest of the FRB
        population. The Milky Way contribution along the line of sight
        is {\ensuremath{\sim}}40 pc cm$^{-3}$, leaving an excess DM of
        {\ensuremath{\sim}}145 pc cm$^{-3}$. The FRB has a fluence >20
        {\ensuremath{\pm}} 7 Jy ms, and is narrow with a width of
        {\ensuremath{\sim}}400 \{{\ensuremath{\mu}}\}s at 10 per cent of

        {\ensuremath{\pm}} 2.7 \{{\ensuremath{\mu}}\}s. The FRB shows
        spectral modulations on frequency scales of 1.5 MHz and 0.1 MHz.
        Both are prominent in the dynamic spectrum, which shows a very
        bright region of emission between 841 and 843 MHz, and weaker
        and patchy emission across the entire band. We show that the

        radio telescope located 40 km from Canberra, Australia. Its
        operating band (820-851 MHz) is partly allocated to
        telecommunications, making radio astronomy challenging. We
        describe how the deployment of new digital receivers, Field
        Programmable Gate Array-based filterbanks, and server-class
        computers equipped with 43 Graphics Processing Units, has
        transformed the telescope into a versatile new instrument
        (UTMOST) for studying the radio sky on millisecond timescales.
        UTMOST has 10 times the bandwidth and double the field of view
        compared to the MOST, and voltage record and playback capability
        has facilitated rapid implementaton of many new observing modes,
        most of which operate commensally. UTMOST can simultaneously
        excise interference, make maps, coherently dedisperse pulsars,
        and perform real-time searches of coherent fan-beams for
        dispersed single pulses. UTMOST operates as a robotic facility,
        deciding how to efficiently target pulsars and how long to stay
        on source via real-time pulsar folding, while searching for
        single pulse events. Regular timing of over 300 pulsars has
        yielded seven pulsar glitches and three Fast Radio Bursts during
        commissioning. UTMOST demonstrates that if sufficient signal

     abstract = "{We present the first interferometric detections of fast radio bursts
        (FRBs), an enigmatic new class of astrophysical transient. In a
        180-d survey of the Southern sky, we discovered three FRBs at
        843 MHz with the UTMOST array, as a part of commissioning
        science during a major ongoing upgrade. The wide field of view
        of UTMOST ({\ensuremath{\approx}}9 deg$^{2}$) is well suited to
        FRB searches. The primary beam is covered by 352 partially
        overlapping fan-beams, each of which is searched for FRBs in
        real time with pulse widths in the range 0.655-42 ms, and
        dispersion measures {\ensuremath{\leq}}2000 pc cm$^{-3}$.
        Detections of FRBs with the UTMOST array place a lower limit on
        their distances of {\ensuremath{\approx}}{}10$^{4}$ km (limit of
        the telescope near-field) supporting the case for an
        astronomical origin. Repeating FRBs at UTMOST or an FRB detected
        simultaneously with the Parkes radio telescope and UTMOST would
        allow a few arcsec localization, thereby providing an excellent
        means of identifying FRB host galaxies, if present. Up to 100 h
        of followup for each FRB has been carried out with the UTMOST,
        with no repeating bursts seen. From the detected position, we
        present 3{\ensuremath{\sigma}} error ellipses of 15 arcsec
        {\texttimes} 8.4{\textdegree} on the sky for the point of origin
        for the FRBs. We estimate an all-sky FRB rate at 843 MHz above a
        fluence F\_lim of 11 Jy ms of {\ensuremath{\sim}}78 events
        sky$^{-1}$ d$^{-1}$ at the 95 per cent confidence level. The
        measured rate of FRBs at 843 MHz is two times higher than we had
        expected, scaling from the FRB rate at the Parkes radio
        telescope, assuming that FRBs have a flat spectral index and a
        uniform distribution in Euclidean space. We examine how this can
        be explained by FRBs having a steeper spectral index and/or a
        flatter logN-logF distribution than expected for a Euclidean
        Universe.}",
