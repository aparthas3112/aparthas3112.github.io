Hi, welcome to my corner of the internet. 

Here you'll find all about my research, software development projects, blog posts and my various side hustles. My CV can be found [here](/cv/).

I'm an astrophysicist. I study neutron stars and use them to search for the weakest gravitational waves in the Universe. Detecting these gravitational waves can help us understand the evolution of galaxies, the dyamics of supermassive black hole mergers and solve some of the biggest fundamental questions in physics. See [this](/projects/gwb) article, where the exciting prospects of such a discovery and how astronomers around the world are collaborating to detect this signal are discussed.

My research also involves software development and data science. I am the lead developer of the data analysis pipeline used for the <a href="https://www.sarao.ac.za/gallery/meerkat/">MeerKAT radio telescope</a> in South Africa. This is one of the most sensitive radio telescopes in the world. I spent a few weeks in Cape Town commissioning this telescope. See [here](/projects/capetown) for some great photos from this trip. 

I also develop Bayesian inference software to aid the detection of weak gravitational waves. [Here](/projects/inference) are some talks and tutorials I have given to students around the world on timing neutron stars, Bayesian statistics and using the relevant software packages.

For a collection of my software development projects, see [here](/projectswebpage). 

I am very passionate about science outreach and have given more than 60 talks to non-scientific audiences around the globe. 

When I'm outdoors, I enjoy long-distance cycling and adventure sports. When indoors, I enjoy gaming. 

Apart from astrophysics, I am passionate about neuroscience, advanced data modelling, formula one and mixology.
