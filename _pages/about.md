Hi, welcome to my corner of the internet. 

Here you'll find all about my research, software development projects, blog posts and my various side hustles. My CV can be found [here](/cv/).

I'm an astrophysicist. I study neutron stars and use them to search for the weakest gravitational waves in the Universe. Detecting these gravitational waves can help us understand the evolution of galaxies, the dyamics of supermassive black hole mergers and solve some of the biggest fundamental questions in physics. On July 29th, 2023, the international pulsar timing array community announced the first compelling evidence of the gravitational wave background! See <a href="https://www.mpifr-bonn.mpg.de/pressreleases/2023/7"> this press release</a>, where my colleagues and I from the <a href="https://www.epta.eu.org/">European Pulsar Timing Array Collaboration (EPTA)</a> discuss the importance of such a discovery. 

Complimentary to radio pulsar timing arrays, I also co-developed the idea of the gamma-ray pulsar timing array (GPTA). See <a href="https://www.mpifr-bonn.mpg.de/pressreleases/2022/6">, this press release</a>, when my colleague Dr. Matthew Kerr and I discuss the potential of the GPTA. 

I recently was awarded a Starting Grant by the European Research Council of around 1.6 million Euros to start my own research group to advance pulsar timing array and gravitaitonal wave science. See <a href="https://www.mpifr-bonn.mpg.de/8093582/erc-aditya-sep2023"> here</a> for some details and <a href="www.google.com"> here</a> is the project webpage. 

My research also involves software development and data science. I am the lead developer of the data analysis pipeline used for the <a href="https://www.sarao.ac.za/gallery/meerkat/">MeerKAT radio telescope</a> in South Africa. This is one of the most sensitive radio telescopes in the world. I spent a few weeks in Cape Town commissioning this telescope. See [here](/projects/capetown) for some photos from this trip. 

I also develop Bayesian inference software to aid the detection of weak gravitational waves. [Here](/projects/inference) are some talks and tutorials I have given to students around the world on timing neutron stars, Bayesian statistics and using the relevant software packages.

For a collection of my software development projects, see [here](/projectswebpage). 

I am very passionate about science outreach and have given more than 60 talks to non-scientific audiences around the globe. 

When I'm outdoors, I enjoy long-distance cycling and adventure sports. When indoors, I enjoy gaming. 

Apart from astrophysics, I am passionate about neuroscience, advanced data modelling, formula one and mixology.
